# Guess my number game

The code in game.mjs is a basic number guessing game. But there is room for lots of improvments. 
Also you will have to do some simple commandline and git operations to complete this challenge.
Remember to use the documentation at mozilla and w3schools to help you with the code (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript and https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). At this point you it is important that you do repetetive tasks to get to the point where you can do them without thinking. i.e. you should be able to write a for loop, decleare a variable etc without looking at the documentation.
Not that this is a challange, we havent shown you how to do everything in the code. You will have to figure some things out on your own. This is a very important skill to have as a developer. 

## Improvments
1. The game should ask the player to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. The number to be guessed should be generated randomly.
3. The game should give the player a hint if the guessed number is too high or too low.
4. The game should ask the player if they want to play again after the game ends.
5. Have the game be localized in different languages.
